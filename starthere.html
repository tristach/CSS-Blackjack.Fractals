        <h2>How this works.</h2>
            <p>
                -This manual is written as just that, a manuel.
                <br>
                -I use a very sticato style to write in to be clear and effective.
                <br>
                -It was based on how people used to write telegraphs at the turn of the 20th century.
                <br>
                -It was effective then and it is effective now.
                <br>
                -When I say a manual though, here is where things get tricky.
                <br>
                -Most technical manuals are written with the minimal amount of human emotion (like building a model,
                follow the directios and you are home free).
                <br>
                -In this venture however, part of the process MUST involve getting to know yourself and what you are
                comfortable with.
                <br>
                -If not, you will fail...pure and simple.
